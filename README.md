## üöÄ Running the Application

### Development Mode
```bash
# Start both frontend and backend concurrently
npm run dev

# Or start individually
npm run backend:dev    # Backend on http://localhost:5000
npm run frontend:dev   # Frontend on http://localhost:3000

## üìä Profit & Loss (P&L) Logic

The P&L calculation follows standard accounting principles:

### Revenue Calculation
- Sum of all **paid** invoices within the selected date range
- Can be calculated by payment date OR issue date (configurable)
- Excludes draft, cancelled, and unpaid invoices

### Expense Calculation  
- Sum of all approved expenses within the date range
- Categorized by expense type (Rent, Utilities, Salaries, etc.)
- Includes receipt attachments and vendor tracking

### Formula
```
Profit/Loss = Total Revenue - Total Expenses
```

### Example (June 2025)
- **Revenue**: MVR 150,000 (from paid invoices)
- **Expenses**: MVR 100,000 (Rent: 25k + Utilities: 5k + Salaries: 50k + Supplies: 20k)
- **Net Profit**: MVR 50,000

## üóÉÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Tables
- **companies**: Business information, settings, and subscription status
- **users**: User accounts with role-based authentication
- **customers**: Customer information and contact details
- **products**: Inventory items with pricing, stock, and portal visibility
- **templates**: Customizable invoice/quote templates with HTML/CSS
- **invoices**: Quotes and invoices with status tracking and template references
- **invoice_items**: Line items for each invoice with product references
